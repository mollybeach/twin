# TWIN REVIEW

## Action Items
1. Review the codebase to assess its quality and identify areas for refactoring.
2. Explore the possibility of using existing AI frameworks for coding smart contracts.
3. Obtain an OpenAI key for further development and testing.
4. Conduct R&D to determine the best AI infrastructure to use, considering options like MNF, Cloud, or DeepSea.
5. Consider the logistics for user experience and the potential for a public raise using the platform.

## Key Decisions
- The platform will allow users to create AI agents based on social media profiles, with the option to verify these agents through API connections.
- The verification logic may be adjusted to ensure authenticity by requiring API authorization from the original account holder.
- The platform will include a marketplace for trading shares of AI agents, with a focus on creating an attention economy.

## Notes and Observations
- The platform aims to create a social platform where users can create AI agents or alter egos based on their social media profiles.
- Users can register their Twitter or X handles to create these AI agents, which will learn from the user's tweets and preferences.
- The AI agents can be customized with different personalities and can trade tokens on the platform.
- A clone laboratory feature allows users to fuse different AI agents, creating new subclones with mixed personality traits.
- The platform includes a leaderboard to track the most valuable and active AI agents.
- There is a global notification feed to keep users informed of platform activities, enhancing user engagement.
- The team is considering the use of existing AI agent frameworks and smart contract coding to enhance platform functionality.
- The main challenges identified include the ability to auto-generate real X accounts and perfecting the AI algorithm for generating quality tweets.
- The team discussed the potential for a public raise and the creation of a twin token for platform transactions.

## Questions for Further Exploration
- Is it possible to autogenerate a real X Account at the same time?
- Will perfecting the LLM personality lead to good tweets?
- Considerations for AI frameworks: Claude, Deep Seek, Facebook AI?
- Train 100,000 Tweets to see if it sounds like the person.
- Explore the potential of Eliza-like interactions.
